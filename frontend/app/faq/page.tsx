                <AccordionContent>
                  Our BMI calculator uses the standard formula recognized by health organizations worldwide: weight (kg)
                  / heightÂ² (m). While BMI is a useful screening tool, it does have limitations. It doesn't distinguish
                  between muscle and fat, and may not be as accurate for athletes, elderly individuals, or pregnant
                  women. We recommend using BMI as one of several health indicators.

                <AccordionContent>
                  For most people, updating measurements once a week or every two weeks is sufficient to track progress
                  effectively. Weighing yourself daily can lead to frustration due to normal weight fluctuations.
                  Consistency is key, so try to take measurements at the same time of day (preferably in the morning)
                  and under similar conditions.

                  Yes, FitLife Monitor allows you to track various health metrics beyond BMI, including body
                  measurements (waist, chest, hips), activity levels, and custom goals. Premium users can also track
                  additional metrics like body fat percentage, muscle mass, and more detailed body composition data.
